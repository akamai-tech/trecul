The Trecul dataflow library is a C++ library for data processing that is architecturally similar to a data base query engine. The library can be used as an ordinary command line executable for processing file and database data on a single machine. However it primary use is to run in Hadoop as a map reduce component for parallel execution. We are also developing code for running dataflow programs in other cluster architectures that support MPI.
